Basic UI Shell using python Tk library

This project contains a basic UI shell using python Tk library. A mini UI with four buttons is displayed. Clicking a botton will execute a function tied to that button as well as show a message on the screen that the action has been executed. This basic foundational UI code using Tk can be easily expanded to define more complicated functions related to the buttons.

Dependencies:
Python 3.11.7 was used. Requires Tkinter/Tk python library.
